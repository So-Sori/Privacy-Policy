    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        The user's data is used in the following way: when the user logs in, their primary calendar corresponding to the email used is accessed, as they interact with the application, they access their calendar events to show them so the user can modify them, delete them, so they can also add new events.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every time the user creates an event in which there is a guest, he will notify the corresponding person of the event. It should be noted that the data is not stored anywhere other than in the user's main calendar in the Google calendar app. The agenda app only displays the data that is located in Google calendar and allows the user to interact with it from its interface. If the user logs out, none of his information would be stored in any cookies or third-party applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application's use and transfer to any other application of information received from Google APIs will comply with the Google API Services User Data Policy, including 'limited use' requirements.
